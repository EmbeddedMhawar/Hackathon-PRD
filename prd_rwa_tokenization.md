# Product Requirements Document: RWA Tokenization

## 1. Introduction
Tokenization of Real World Assets (RWAs) refers to the process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. This process can enhance liquidity, enable fractional ownership, and improve transparency and efficiency in managing and trading real-world assets.

## 2. Goals
- To enable the fractional ownership of high-value real-world assets.
- To increase liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets.
- To provide a transparent and immutable record of ownership and transaction history.
- To reduce administrative overhead and costs associated with asset management and transfer.
- To expand access to investment opportunities in real-world assets.

## 3. Target Audience
- Asset Owners: Individuals or entities looking to tokenize their assets for liquidity or fractionalization.
- Investors: Individuals or institutions seeking to invest in tokenized real-world assets.
- Platform Operators/Service Providers: Entities that will facilitate the tokenization process, manage the platform, and ensure regulatory compliance.
- Regulators: Bodies overseeing the legal and compliance aspects of asset tokenization.

## 4. User Stories
- As an Asset Owner, I want to easily submit my asset for tokenization so that I can unlock its value.
- As an Asset Owner, I want to define the terms of the tokenization (e.g., total supply, price per token) so that I have control over the process.
- As an Investor, I want to browse available tokenized assets so that I can find suitable investment opportunities.
- As an Investor, I want to securely purchase tokens representing fractional ownership of an asset so that I can diversify my portfolio.
- As an Investor, I want to view the transaction history and ownership details of my tokens so that I have transparency.
- As a Platform Operator, I want to have a robust KYC/AML process for users so that we comply with regulations.
- As a Platform Operator, I want to manage the lifecycle of tokenized assets (issuance, trading, redemption) so that the platform runs smoothly.

## 5. Requirements

### 5.1. Functional Requirements
- **User Registration and KYC/AML:** Secure onboarding process for users, including identity verification.
- **Asset Submission:** Process for asset owners to submit assets for evaluation and tokenization.
- **Tokenization Engine:** Core module to create and issue tokens on a supported blockchain.
- **Asset Valuation:** Mechanism for valuing assets to determine token price.
- **Marketplace:** Platform for listing and trading tokenized assets.
- **Wallet Integration:** Secure wallet for users to store and manage their tokens.
- **Voting/Governance (Optional):** For certain assets, allow token holders to vote on decisions.
- **Reporting and Analytics:** Provide users and operators with relevant data and reports.
- **Dividend/Yield Distribution (If applicable):** Mechanism to distribute income generated by the underlying asset to token holders.

### 5.2. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security:** End-to-end security measures, including smart contract audits, data encryption, and secure infrastructure.
- **Scalability:** The platform must be able to handle a growing number of users, assets, and transactions.
- **Performance:** Fast transaction processing and responsive user interface.
- **Usability:** Intuitive and user-friendly interface for all user types.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Adherence to relevant legal and financial regulations in target jurisdictions.
- **Interoperability (Optional):** Potential to interact with other blockchain platforms or DeFi protocols.
- **Auditability:** All transactions and ownership changes must be auditable on the blockchain.

### 5.3. Blockchain Specific Requirements
- Choice of Blockchain: Hedera.
  - Justification: Hedera is chosen for its high throughput (capable of 10,000+ TPS), low and predictable transaction fees, robust security model (aBFT consensus), and its energy-efficient network, making it suitable for enterprise-grade RWA tokenization applications.
- Smart Contract Standards: (e.g., ERC-20 for fungible tokens, ERC-721/ERC-1155 for non-fungible representations of assets).

## 6. Future Considerations
- Integration with Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols for lending, borrowing, and staking of tokenized assets.
- Cross-chain compatibility to allow movement of tokenized assets across different blockchains.
- Development of more sophisticated financial instruments based on tokenized RWAs.
- Enhanced AI-driven analytics for asset valuation and risk assessment.
- Expansion to new asset classes.
